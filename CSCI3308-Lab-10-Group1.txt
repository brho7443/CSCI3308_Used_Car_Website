Application Name: Wheel Wizard

Application Description: Our application, Wheel Wizard, gives the user an interactive marketplace to buy or sell cars along with car accessories. There will be a login page to control which users use our application. This also allows the user to save cars to their profile along with saving their searches for cars. Along with the login page, there will be a logout page to log the user out as well as a registration page for new users to signup. After logging in or registering, the user will be redirected to the home page that has 3 cards with the options of buying, selling, or accessories. Based on the user’s selection they will be redirected to the desired page.

The buying page allows users to browse cars that are for sale. The user can filter these by color, make, model, etc. They can then see a picture of the car’s within their filter with the price of that car. The selling page allows users to post a car for sale. They enter in the required fields of make, model, color, and the price they want to sell it for. Then the application will move the post into the database of all selling cars and allow other users to see that car.
The final page is for buying accessories. This will be similar to the car buying page, except it's all for accessories. For example, there will be steering wheel covers, car air fresheners, seat covers, etc. 


Vision Statement: 
For people who want to buy a used car. Wheel wizards is a website that provides information about used cars to buy.
